I Just Love Videogames!

Since I was a child and had a chance to play a Game Boy Color and I think it still is one of my best memorable childhood moments. Since then i found my passion for music, movies and technology. Each one with it`s own peculiar way of expression, but i never thought that i could turn this passion into work, until I had the opportunity to work with Scratch and everything changed, because I started to see game development as a future for me.

A few years later Unity3D as a hobby when i was already at University, then I had my final paper to do... and it was clear to me that i should build my own game that I did not even hesitate and the good surprise was that i received the maximum grade.

While working at AWS at the Data Center (what I can tell is that Watch Dogs is not closer to get all the complexity of it, just kidding), I still had the chance to work with Games when I presented a gamification solution for a highly complexity training and when i got the Third Place on a internal (12 hours) Hackathon to develop a game for Woot (one of the Amazon`s company).

Now I`m clearly decided that this is what I really want for the rest of my work days!
